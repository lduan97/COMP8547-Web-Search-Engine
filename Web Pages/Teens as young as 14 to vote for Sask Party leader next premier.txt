Party leader, next premier Saskatchewan youth who are not eligible to vote in a provincial election will be able to help select the next premier this month. Social Sharing Vote for leader to replace Premier Brad Wall scheduled for Jan. 27 CBC News · Posted: Jan 10, 2018 7:00 AM CT | Last Updated: January 10, 2018 Sask. Party Youth president Tye Hapke, left, addresses members at a Sask Party Convention. Hapke says allowing party members as young as 14 to vote for the party's next leader gives young people a voice. (Photo submitted by Tye Hapke.) Saskatchewan youth who are not yet eligible to vote in a general election will be able to help select the province's next premier this month. More than 1,800 people between the ages of 14 and 25 currently hold Saskatchewan Party memberships. On Jan. 27, those young people will get to cast their vote, many for the first time, at the party's leadership convention. The person chosen to lead the party that day will also take over from Brad Wall as premier of Saskatchewan. Since Wall announced his upcoming retirement in August 2017, the party has grown from 9,500 members to 27,125, as of Dec. 18, 2017. Sask. Party brings in $385K in memberships since leadership race began "Anyone who is a member should have a say in who our next leader is," said Tye Hapke, 20, the president of the Sask. Party's youth executive. "It allows the youth a very sizable voice to decide where they want to see the party go in the next few years. "It allows them to voice their own issues that they may have with our party policy, with the government policy, to the leadership vote, so that they can take that into account." Hapke, who first got involved with the party during the 2016 provincial election, said he has friends working on all five of the Sask. Party leadership campaigns. "Each candidate has their own appeal to young members," he said. "I wouldn't say there is one specific youth candidate, if you want to call it that." While Hapke is excited that youth will have a say in the party's leadership, there has been debate about the idea on social media. Today I learned that 14 year olds can become SK Party members. So, in theory, the next Premier could be chosen by people not old enough to vote in the next election <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/skpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#skpoli</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pickapremier?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pickapremier</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/newmeaningtoyouthvote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#newmeaningtoyouthvote</a>&mdash;@kathysaskie one of our staffs 14 YO son became a member to vote.
