"We're a have-province now, we have lots of wealth, our population growth that's happening in this province. We need to thank him for what he's done, because he's done a remarkable job." Meanwhile, Saskatoon Mayor Charlie Clark said he had his differences with Wall, notably in recent funding changes to the province's towns and cities. "I haven't agreed with every decision he's made," he said. 'But that never stopped us from being able to talk to each other and being able to deal with each other in our efforts, trying to do the best on behalf of our province and our communities." Wall said he would stay on as premier until the party elects a new leader.
